# Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Models with easy to understand codes in Python and using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Linear Regression model applied on Soccer League SERIA A dataset
The Linear Regression model is trained with the Seria A dataset.
Each part has two approaches: 
#### Approach(1) : In this appraoch I use top 10 teams for training and bottom 10 teams for testing.
#### Approach(2) : Used the results of randomly selected 10 teams as a training set and applied the trained model to the remaining 10 teams. Repeated this experiment 20 times and calculated the predicted result of each team as an average result over all experimeents.

## Naive Bayes Classifier for Sentimental Ananlysis,Attitude Ananlysis(without using any library)
Implementation of Naive Bayes classifier on product review and predicting the attitude of customer whether it is positive or negative.
No Machine Learning Model libraries were used in the implementation.

## Principal Component Analysis and Multi-Dimensional Scaling on DNA dataset
Using some encoding to convert the DNA character sequence to numeric sequence. These sequences are our feature vectors
Using both PCA and MDS to get 2 dimensional DNA data.
Finally applying K-means technique for clusring the 2 dimensional data.
